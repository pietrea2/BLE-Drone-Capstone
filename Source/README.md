# BLE-AOA-Drone-Swarms
Using BLE AOA to locate and control a bunch of drones!

## AOA_get_location.py
> **DUE BY SUNDAY FEB 12**

Connect to the anchor using COM serial port.
Using AT commands found in https://content.u-blox.com/sites/default/files/XPLR-AOA-Explorer-kits_UserGuide_UBX-21004616.pdf, we will poll (with a loop, timer, etc) the location of each drone to use for the control system.
The communication will be handled with PySerial.

## triangulation.py
> **DUE BY SUNDAY FEB 12**

The triangulation calculation from the serial information gathered from the AOA_get_location.py code. 
After the angular information is recieved, calculate the cartesian coordinate of each drone based on the predetermined location of each AOA anchor. 
The coordinate information gathered is what will be sent to the control interface and the control system code.
* The number & location of each anchor will be an input



## control_interface.py
> **DUE BY SUNDAY FEB 12**

The drone will be facing only one direction to simplify control commands
Main GUI/Text interface for sending commands to the drone. The commands will be likely as follows:
* Arm/Disarm drone
* Liftoff/Land
* Climb <# meters>
* Descend <# meters>
* Move left/right/forward/backward <# meters>


## control.py
The main entrypoint for all the control algorithms for the drones.
Inputs will likely be throttle information used on the joystick, sent out through bluetooth to each drone.

## comm_seeed.py
Somehow connect to the drone (Seeed). Find a way to connect either through the AOA board or through the laptop's bluetooth module
